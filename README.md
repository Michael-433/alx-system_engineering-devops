# System Engineering and DevOps - Bash, Scripting, Web Stack/Web Stack Debugging, Networking & Security, CI/CD
    
    This repository contains programs written for the system engineering and DevOps track at Alx Software Engineering program. In these projects, I worked with Bash and practiced writing Bash scripts to automate tasks. I learned about the OSI model and various Linux networking tools. Further, I configured a distributed system - two web servers and one load balancer - for deployment of my AirBnB project using Nginx, HAProxy, certbot, ufw, and MySQL. The specific list of projects contained follows:
<ul>
    <li> 0x00. Shell, basics
    <li> 0x01. Shell, permissions
    <li> 0x02. Shell, I/O Redirections and filters
    <li> 0x03. Shell, init files, variables and expansions
    <li> 0x04. Loops, conditions and parsing
    <li> 0x05. Processes and signals
    <li> 0x06. Regular expression
    <li> 0x07. Networking basics #0
    <li> 0x08. Networking basics #1
</ul>
