# SSH
SSH is a secure protocol used as the primary means of connecting to Linux servers remotely. It provides a text-based interface by spawning a remote shell. After connecting, all commands you type in your local terminal are sent to the remote server and executed there.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, I was expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- What is a server
- Where servers usually live
- What is SSH
- How to create an SSH RSA key pair
- How to connect to a remote host using an SSH RSA key pair
- The advantage of using #!/usr/bin/env bash instead of /bin/bash
